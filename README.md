# C++ Localisation

This repository will (eventually) contain a fairly easy to use Localisation system.  It isn't designed to be perfect, but it is designed to lean on linguistic principles *over* standard computational means.

**Until version 0.1.0 the API for this library will be up the in air.  We are trying to nail down something useful, but not overly stressful to implement.**

## Changes

## Platform Support

While it is too early to make a definitive call, the aim is to ensure that only the standard library, and platform libraries, are required for this code to function.
